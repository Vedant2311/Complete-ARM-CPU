# Complete-ARM-CPU

This repository consists of the different versions of an ARM based CPU written by me using VHDL language. I made use of Xilinx tools in order to run the simulations of the system and programmed an FPGA board. A brief summary of these different versions are as follows (for more detailed explanation, go through their corresponding README files)

1. **Single-Cycle-Processor**: A Single Cycle ARM processor implemented in VHDL 

2. **Multi-Cycle-Processor-1**: A Multi Cycle ARM processor having all the ARM instructions along with Exceptions 

3. **Multi-Cycle-Processor-2**: A Multi Cycle ARM Processor capable of taking inputs from a Keypad Peripheral Module of FPGA
